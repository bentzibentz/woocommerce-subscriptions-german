# German formal (Sie) for WooCommerce Subscriptions Plugin
Unfortunately the [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/de-de/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) Plugin does not come with a German formal language file.

I try to keep the file up to date on plugin updates, feel free to open a pull request.

## Installation
Place the ```woocommerce-subscriptions-en_DE_formal.mo``` and ```woocommerce-subscriptions-en_DE_formal.po``` files at the following position of your wordpress project ```wp-content/languages/plugins```.
